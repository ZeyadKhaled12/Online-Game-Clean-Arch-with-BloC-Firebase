### This  project is a online game created by flutter & firebase.


#### **Idea  of the game:**
* 3 or more  players get in room, when the man who create  the  room start the game there is a word show in the screen like(cat, phone, etc..).

* One of them dont know the word(in the game called kaito), after the game start there will be a few questions appear on the screen for each player.

* Every player has 3 options to answer the question(yes, no, skipped), when the player skipped a question the other players couldn't know what was the question because every player can see only his question.

* There is a trap questions like(No question), in this case the player don't even have the option to answer so he will skipped it and that's will make other players suspect in him if he wasthe kaito or not.

* when the questions finish they have to vote who is kaito.

* Repeat....
